# Spring Cloud Stream Fraud Applications

Custom https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/[Spring Cloud App Starter] that extends the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/docs/Einstein.SR3/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-cloud-stream-modules-tensorflow-processor[TensorFlow Processor] to support a specific Tensorflow model build for the the https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/predicting-fraud-with-tensorflow[Credit Card Fraud Detection] solution.

A pre-trained, binary model is already bundled with this project at https://github.com/tzolov/cdc-fraud-detection-demo/blob/master/fraud-detection-app-starters/spring-cloud-starter-stream-processor-fraud-detection/src/main/resources/fraud_detection_graph.pb[fraud_detection_graph.pb]. To (re)train the model you can use the following python script: https://github.com/tzolov/cdc-fraud-detection-demo/blob/master/fraud-detection-app-starters/spring-cloud-starter-stream-processor-fraud-detection/model/train-model.py[train-model.py]. Later is a direct copy of the https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/predicting-fraud-with-tensorflow[original Kaggle solution], customized to export the trained model in a Protobuf `fraud_detection_graph.pb` file.

The Fraud Detection Processor expects an input JSON messages in the following format:

```
{
 "time":453,
 "v1":1.13154130503628,
 "v2":-0.174361326933011,
 ... ,
 "v28":0.034254726765817,
 "amount":52.4
 }
```

This format strictly matches the column names that types of the original dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Only the `Class` column is intentionally removed, because the fraud/normal status of the input transaction is unknown in advance!
 Instead the fraud-detection processor evaluates result using the pre-trained Tensorflow model. The output result is a single json message, that can be either: `{ "detection":"FRAUD" }` or `{ "detection":"NORMAL" }`
